# Data Storage & Versioning

## Sample Data

We can generate some sample data to use to test the different 
components of Kapitan Hull.

=== "Run:ai YAML"

    ```bash
    # Change the values within the file if any before running this
    kubectl apply -f aisg-context/runai/03b-data-download.yml
    ```

In the next section, we will work towards processing this set of raw
data and eventually 'training' a dummy model.
