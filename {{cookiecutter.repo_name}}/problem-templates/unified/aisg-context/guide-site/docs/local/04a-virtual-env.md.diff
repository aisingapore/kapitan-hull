 We can create a virtual environment that will contain all the 
 dependencies required for this guide.
 
 ```bash
-conda env create -f {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-conda-env.yaml
+conda env create -f project-conda-env.yaml
 ```
 
 The Conda YAML configuration file uses the `requirements.txt` to create
 a Conda environment. This is so that there is parity between the 
 development and deployment environment as the Docker image would use 
 `requirements.txt` as the list of packages to be installed.

+You may have to do extra pip installations, depending on your project's
+requirements. You can install them through `pip install -r <file>`.
