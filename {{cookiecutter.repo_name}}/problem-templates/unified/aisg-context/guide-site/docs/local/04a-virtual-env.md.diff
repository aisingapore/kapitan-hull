 We can create a virtual environment that will contain all the 
 dependencies required for this guide.

 to carry out some workflows, we can still make use of our local
 machine to execute some of the steps of the end-to-end machine learning
 workflow.

 The Conda YAML configuration file uses the `requirements.txt` to create
 a Conda environment. This is so that there is parity between the 
 development and deployment environment as the Docker image would use 
 `requirements.txt` as the list of packages to be installed.
