+    You would most probably be resorting to 
+    [AI Singapore's GitLab instance][aisg-gitlab] as the remote. Refer 
+    to [this section][cr8-proj] on creating a blank remote _repository_ 
+    (or _project_ using GitLab's terminology).  
+
+    Go to [this section][gitlab-page] for more information on 
+    interacting with the on-premise GitLab instance.

+## Guide's Problem Statement
+
+This guide follows the base version of the template. For other problem 
+templates, you may need to generate it yourself by following the steps
+in the [README][readme] under the Usage section.
+
+For the other problem templates, you can check their problem statement
+below for reference.
+
+=== "Computer Vision"
+
+    For this guide, we will work towards building a neural network that 
+    is able to classify handwritten digits, widely known as the MNIST 
+    use-case. The model is then to be deployed through a REST API and 
+    used for batch inferencing as well.  
+    The raw dataset to be used is obtainable through a Google Cloud 
+    Storage bucket; instructions for downloading the data into your 
+    development environment are detailed under "Data Storage & 
+    Versioning" in their respective sections.
