+## Guide's Problem Statement
+
+This guide follows the base version of the template. For other problem 
+templates, you may need to generate it yourself by following the steps
+in the [README][readme] under the Usage section.
+
+For the other problem templates, you can check their problem statement
+below for reference.
+
+=== "Computer Vision"
+
+    For this guide, we will work towards building a neural network that 
+    is able to classify handwritten digits, widely known as the MNIST 
+    use-case. The model is then to be deployed through a REST API and 
+    used for batch inferencing as well.  
+    The raw dataset to be used is obtainable through a Google Cloud 
+    Storage bucket; instructions for downloading the data into your 
+    development environment are detailed under "Data Storage & 
+    Versioning" in their respective sections.
