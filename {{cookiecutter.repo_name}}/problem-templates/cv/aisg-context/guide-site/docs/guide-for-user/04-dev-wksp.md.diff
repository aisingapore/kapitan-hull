 We can make use of [Coder][coder] to spin up VSCode servers with which 
 cluster resources can be dedicated.
 
-Ask your administrator on setting up Coder in your Kubernetes cluster.

 ## VSCode
+
+### Prebuilt VSCode Server
+
+The MLOps team should have spun up a Coder instance in the cluster and 
+handed the URL to you. The only thing you would need to do is to log 
+into Coder with OpenID Connect:
+
+![Coder Login](assets/screenshots/coder-login-vscode.png)
+
+Once you're in, you should be seeing something similar to this:
+
+![Coder Workspace](assets/screenshots/coder-workspace.png)
+
+If you do not see a workspace running, or you could not access the 
+Coder workspace allocated to you, you can contact the MLOps team.
+
+If you have the permissions, you could also create a workspace on your 
+own. The template you have access to will only work for one workspace 
+at a time, so you could switch out workspaces with different CPU and 
+RAM resources, depending on the needs of your team's project 
+requirements.
+
+Recommended settings for your first time are as follows:
+
+- __Workspace Name:__ `<YOUR_HYPHENATED_NAME>-vscode`
+- CPU: 2 Cores
+- Memory: 4GB
+
+![Coder create new workspace](assets/screenshots/coder-create-workspace.png)
+
+If all of it runs normally, you should have two buttons: VS Code 
+Desktop and code-server. Click on the latter to start running the 
+remote VSCode Workspace.
+
+![Coder workspace running](assets/screenshots/coder-workspace-running.png)
+
+You should be directed to the VSCode server welcome tab without 
+password prompt.

+
+### Persistent Workspaces
+
+As mentioned, a PVC should be attached to the workspaces to persist
+changes to the filesystems. You can use the following command to search
+for the PVC:
+
+=== "VSCode Server Terminal"
+
+    ```bash
+    ls -la / | grep "pvc"
+    ```
+
+??? info "Reference Link(s)"
+
+    - [Kubernetes Docs - Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes)
+
+If there's no result, check with the MLOps team about this.
+
+By default, the PVCs would contain a `workspaces` directory with which
+you can create a subdirectory for yourself treat it as your own 
+personal workspace, where all your work and other relevant assets can 
+be persisted.
+
+=== "VSCode Server Terminal"
+
+    ```bash
+    cd /<PVC_LOCATION>/workspaces
+    mkdir <YOUR_HYPHENATED_NAME>
+    ```
