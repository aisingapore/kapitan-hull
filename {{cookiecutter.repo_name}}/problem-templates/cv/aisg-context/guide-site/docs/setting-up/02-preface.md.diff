+## Guide's Problem Statement
+
+For this guide, we will work towards building a neural network that is
+able to classify handwritten digits, widely known as the MNIST use-case.
+The model is then to be deployed through a REST API and used for batch
+inferencing as well.  
+The raw dataset to be used is obtainable through a Google Cloud Storage
+bucket; instructions for downloading the data into your development
+environment are detailed under "Data Storage & Versioning" in their
+respective sections ([running locally][local-data], with 
+[Docker][docker-data], etc.), to be referred to later on.
