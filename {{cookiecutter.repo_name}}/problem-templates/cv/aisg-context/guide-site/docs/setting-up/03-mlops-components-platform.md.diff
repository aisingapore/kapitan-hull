+
+### Harbor Projects, Membership & Roles
+
+For you to push any image to Harbor, you would need authorised access
+to projects i.e. membership in a project. Projects can be public or
+private. From the docs:
+
+> *There are two types of project in Harbor:*
+>
+> - *Public: Any user can pull images from this project. This is a*
+> *convenient way for you to share repositories with others.*
+> - *Private: Only users who are members of the project can pull images.*
+
+Hence, do ensure that you have rightful access to your project team's
+Harbor project in order for you to push any relevant images that you
+have built. Do contact the MLOps team (`mlops@aisingapore.org`) for
+access matters.
+
+!!! note
+    On your first ever login to Harbor, you would not have any
+    membership access to any projects. This is because projects can
+    only add users who have logged into Harbor at least once. Should
+    you want to be added to a project on Harbor, do notify the MLOps
+    team following your first login.
+
+With that said, not all membership is equal i.e. one would need to be
+assigned the membership roles of either `Project Admin`, `Master`, or
+`Developer` for pushing permissions.
+
+For more information on the aforementioned concepts, do refer to the
+reference links below.

+### Robot Accounts
+
+Aside from using your own credentials to interact with the registry,

+nothing for end-users to configure the usage of NFS storage as most of
