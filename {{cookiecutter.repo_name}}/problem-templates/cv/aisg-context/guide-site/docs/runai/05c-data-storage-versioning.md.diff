 ## Sample Data
 
-We can generate some sample data to use to test the different 
-components of Kapitan Hull.
+While you may have your own project data to work with, for the purpose
+of following through with this template guide, let's download the 
+sample data for the [sample problem statement][prob] at hand within our 
+VSCode server workspace.
+
+[prob]: ../setting-up/02-preface.md#guides-problem-statement
 
 === "Coder Workspace Terminal"
 
     ```bash
-    mkdir -p /<NAME_OF_DATA_SOURCE>/workspaces/<YOUR_HYPHENATED_NAME>/data/raw && cd "$_"
-    echo "Test1" > data1.txt
-    echo "Test2" > data2.txt
-    echo "Test3" > data3.txt
+    mkdir -p /<NAME_OF_DATA_SOURCE>/workspaces/<YOUR_HYPHENATED_NAME>/data && cd "$_"

+!!! info
+    The sample data for this guide's problem statement is made
+    accessible to the public. Hence any team or individual can download
+    it. It is highly likely that your project's data is not publicly
+    accessible and neither should it be, especially if it is a 100E
+    project.
+
 In the next section, we will work towards processing this set of raw
-data and eventually 'training' a dummy model.
