 The Conda YAML configuration file uses the `requirements.txt` to create
 a Conda environment. This is so that there is parity between the 
 development and deployment environment as the Docker image would use 
 `requirements.txt` as the list of packages to be installed.

+You will have to do an extra pip installation, depending on whether you
+rely on the CPU-only or GPU-enabled variant. You can make use of these
+requirements files:
+
+```bash
+# CPU-only
+pip install -r pytorch-cpu-requirements.txt
+
+# GPU-enabled
+pip install -r pytorch-gpu-requirements.txt
+```
