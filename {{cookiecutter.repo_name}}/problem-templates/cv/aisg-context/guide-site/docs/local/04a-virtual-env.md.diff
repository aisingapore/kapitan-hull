 a Conda environment. This is so that there is parity between the 
 development and deployment environment as the Docker image would use 
 `requirements.txt` as the list of packages to be installed.
 
+You will have to do an extra pip installation, depending on whether you
+rely on the CPU-only or GPU-enabled variant. You can make use of these
+requirements files:

+```bash

 !!! info "On the use of GPUs"
-    Conda environment configured using the YAML file does not take into
-    account whether you need extra requirements to use your GPU for
-    training/inference. Check the instructions on your ML/AI framework
-    of choice to configure your Conda environment to suit your needs.
+    If you're using an AMD or an Intel ARC GPU, we do not provide 
+    support for them at the moment. In the meantime, you can check the
+    following sites to see what you would need to modify to run on 
+    those GPUS:

+    - AMD GPUs: https://pytorch.org/
+    - Intel ARC GPUs: https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/index.html#installation?request=platform
 
 Activate your environment by running:
