 # Virtual Environments
 
-We can create a virtual environment that will contain all the 
-dependencies required for this guide.
+While we will be making use of AI Singapore's remote infrastructure

+workflow. Hence, we can begin by creating a virtual environment that

 a Conda environment. This is so that there is parity between the 
 development and deployment environment as the Docker image would use 
 `requirements.txt` as the list of packages to be installed.
 
+In this exercise, the template includes training with a XGBoost Regressor model.
+The XGBoost binary packages support the GPU algorithm (device=cuda:0) on

 !!! info "On the use of GPUs"
-    Conda environment configured using the YAML file does not take into
-    account whether you need extra requirements to use your GPU for
-    training/inference. Check the instructions on your ML/AI framework
-    of choice to configure your Conda environment to suit your needs.
+    If you're using an AMD or an Intel ARC GPU, we do not provide 
+    support for them at the moment. In the meantime, you can check the
+    following sites to see what you would need to modify to run on 
+    those GPUS:
+    
+    - AMD GPUs: https://github.com/ROCm/xgboost
+    - Intel ARC GPUs: There is no known support for XGboost on Intel GPUs.
 
 Activate your environment by running:
