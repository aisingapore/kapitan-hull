 ## Docker Image Debugging

+While we will be making use of AI Singapore's remote infrastructure
+to carry out some workflows, we can still make use of our local
+machine to execute some of the steps of the end-to-end machine learning
+workflow. Hence, we can begin by creating a virtual environment that
+will contain all the dependencies required for this guide. This
 requires the Docker image to be built from a Dockerfile
 (`docker/{{cookiecutter.src_package_name}}-cpu.Dockerfile`)
