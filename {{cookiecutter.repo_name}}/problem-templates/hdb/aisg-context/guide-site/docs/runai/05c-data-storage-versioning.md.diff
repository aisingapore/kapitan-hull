 ## Sample Data
 
-We can generate some sample data to use to test the different 
-components of Kapitan Hull.
+While you may have your own project data to work with, for the purpose
+of following through with this template guide, let's download the 
+HDB resale prices data for the [sample problem statement][prob] at hand within 
+our Coder workspace.

 In the next section, we will work towards processing this set of raw
-data and eventually 'training' a dummy model.
