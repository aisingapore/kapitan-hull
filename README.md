## Preface

This repository contains the [`cookiecutter`][ccutter] template for 
generating a repository that provides boilerplates touching on the 
differing components of an end-to-end ML project. 

For now, this template is dedicated for AI Singapore's on-premise 
environment, and where Run:ai is used as the MLOps platform. Other 
platforms and orchestrators would be integrated to this repository in
the near future.

## Usage

### Creating new repository

To use the template and create a repository, you would need to install
the `cookiecutter` CLI, say within a virtual environment and pass the
URL of this template as an argument, like such:

```bash
# Ensure that python>=3.10
$ pip install "cookiecutter>=2.2" unidiff
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/aisingapore/kapitan-hull
```

> For some reason, macOS would not install the `cookiecutter` CLI. If
> that's the case, you would either need to use `conda install` (if 
> you're using Conda), or follow the instructions on the
> [`cookieccutter` guide site][ccutter-inst] using `pipx`.

[ccutter-inst]: https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html#installation

If you want to run a specific version of Kapitan Hull for compatibility 
reasons, you can specify the `-c` parameter for the specific tag/branch
we have:

```bash
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/aisingapore/kapitan-hull -c <tag>
```

You will then be prompted to provide inputs. These inputs will be used 
to populate different parts of the repository to be generated by
`cookiecutter`.

### Updating your repository

If you want to update the repository with updated utilities, 
***push all your changes in your repository first***. After that, you 
can run this command in the repository:

```bash
# Add `-c <tag>` for the specific tag/branch
$ cookiecutter --replay-file cookiecutter.json \
    https://github.com/aisingapore/kapitan-hull \
    -o .. -f
```

### Version Control

Following the creation of your repository, initialise it with Git, push 
it to a remote, and follow its `README.md` document for a full guide on 
its usage.

## Development

To reduce the size and check the explicit changes between the base
template and the various problem templates, we opt for the use of diff
files within Kapitan Hull to store the differences within the 
repository. As such it is essential that developers would know how to 
apply patches for development, and regenerate the diff files to commit 
those changes.

### Applying Diff Patch

You can apply a specific patch as such:

```bash
python hooks/pre_prompt.py apply <diff_file>
```

### Creating Diff Patch

You can create a specific patch as such:

```bash
python extras/generate_diffs.py create <alt_file>
```

This `<alt_file>` refers to the file that is to be committed as a diff
file in the `problem-templates/<template>` folder.

> Note: When creating a diff patch, ensure that the base file and the
>       other file have an extra newline at the end to avoid patching
>       issues using the scripts.

## Note on AMD GPUs

Those who plan to use AMD GPUs and RoCM can check the `extras/rocm` 
folder and copy the contents into the `{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}` 
folder before populating your template. This is experimental, so 
official support for this should not be expected any time soon. This is 
also not added to the main template to reduce the confusion of having 
multiple file variants for the users.
