## Preface

This repository contains the [`cookiecutter`][ccutter] template for 
generating a repository that provides boilerplates touching on the 
differing components of an end-to-end ML project. 

For now, this template is dedicated for AI Singapore's on-premise 
environment, and where Run:ai is used as the MLOps platform. Other 
platforms and orchestrators would be integrated to this repository in
the near future.

[ccutter]: https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

## Usage

To use the template and create a repository, you would need to install
the `cookiecutter` CLI, say within a virtual environment and pass the
URL of this template as an argument, like such:

```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/aisingapore/kapitan-hull
```

You will then be prompted to provide inputs.These inputs will be used to
populate different parts of the repository to be generated by
`cookiecutter`.

> **Note**: Your cookiecutter version must be at least ***2.2.0***.
