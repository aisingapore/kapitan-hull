## Preface

This repository contains the
[`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
template for generating a repository that provides boilerplates touching
on the differing components of an end-to-end ML project. This template
is dedicated for AI Singapore's on-premise environment, and where
Run:ai is used as the MLOps platform.

## Usage

To use the template and create a repository, you would need to install
the `cookiecutter` CLI, say within a virtual environment and pass the
URL of this template as an argument, like such:

```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/aisingapore/ml-project-cookiecutter-onprem-runai
```

You will then be prompted to provide inputs.These inputs will be used to
populate different parts of the repository to be generated by
`cookiecutter`.
